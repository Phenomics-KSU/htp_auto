These instructions are for setting up a computer to run ROS and also download/build the htp package for Husky.

ROS lines up with certain versions of Ubuntu.  
Hydro -> 12.04 LTS (Precise)
Indigo -> 14.04 LTS (Trusty)

The first step is written for Hydro, but should be easily modified for using Indigo.

Step 1: Install ROS
Follow the instructions in this link:
Note - select the desktop-full install.
http://wiki.ros.org/hydro/Installation/Ubuntu

Step 2: Install Git
First install git by running:
sudo apt-get install git-core

Then enable git colors on the command line using:
git config --global color.ui auto

Then setup your information:
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email youremail@whatever

Step 3: Install Husky Packages
Run the following install command:
sudo apt-get install ros-hydro-husky-robot ros-hydro-husky-desktop

Step 4: Setup 'htp_auto' Package
Open a terminal and cd to your home directory.
cd ~

Create a directy there named 'ros' and change into it
mkdir ros
cd ros

Create a subdirecty inside 'ros' named 'src' and change into it
mkdir src
cd src

Obtain the URL to clone the repo.  You can do this by going to github and searching 'htp_auto'.  Then select the text in the HTTPS box.  Currently the link is:
https://github.com/Phenomics-KSU/htp_auto.git

Still in the '~/ros/src' directly run:
git clone <URL> (where <URL> is from github)
So using the link above it would be:
git clone https://github.com/Phenomics-KSU/htp_auto.git

You can then build the package by going back to '~/ros' and running:
catkin_make

Step 5: Install Eclipse (optional but recommended)
Follow this link and download "Eclipse IDE for C/C++ Developers"
http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/?osType=linux

cd to the directy you downloaded it to and extract using:
tar -zxvf eclipse.XX.YY.tar.gz

Become root and copy the extracted folder to /opt
sudo mv eclipse.XX.YY /opt

Create a symlink in /usr/local/bin using:
sudo ln -s /opt/eclipse/eclipse /usr/local/bin/eclipse44

Install either JRE or JDK.  I just installed JRE since I wasn't planning on doing java development.
sudo apt-get install openjdk-7-jre

If you want to install an icon you can follow the rest of the steps:
Note* - you'll usually want to launch eclipse from the command line (see below) so I didn't do this part.

Then to setup a ROS project in eclipse follow the other documentation file detailing how to do that.
