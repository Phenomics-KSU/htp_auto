Summarized from http://wiki.ros.org/IDEs

1) Go to workspace root directory (/ros)
2) run "catkin_make --force-cmake -G"Eclipse CDT4 - Unix Makefiles""
3) run "awk -f $(rospack find mk)/eclipse.awk build/.project > build/.project_with_env && mv build/.project_with_env build/.project"
4) Open eclipse 
5) File -> Import -> General -> Existing Project to Workspace
6) Select build directory (/ros/build/) and DO NOT check "Copy projects into workspace"
7) Close Eclipse.

Whenever you open Eclipse do it from the terminal to import shell environment:
run "bash -i -c "eclipse44"  (the 44 denotes Luna 4.4)

If you get a warning about not being to find a 'test' directory in the include paths then remove that directly from the list of project include paths.  It can sometimes silently mess up the build command.

If still can't resolve some symbols try:
Navigate to Project -> C/C++ General -> Preprocessor Include Paths -> Provides tab
Then check the box for CDT GCC Compiler Build-in Settings [shared]
Right click on project -> Index -> Rebuild

If any project dependencies change you have to rebuild eclipse project files to synchronize.
