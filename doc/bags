To start recording data in a bag:
1) Open a new terminal tab (ctrl+shift+T)
2) cd into '~/bags' (create it if doesn't exist)
3) rosbag record -O filename /topic_name_to_record
4) when finished stop bagging with ctrl+C

For example to log position data run
rosbag record -O ashland_field_5 /robot_pose_ekf/odom_combined /home

And after your finished a bag file should be created called
~/bags/ashland_field_5.bag

Then to view information about it run:
rosbag info ashland_field_5.bag

Then to move it back see the 'transfer' help document.
