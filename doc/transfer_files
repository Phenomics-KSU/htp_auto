To transfer a file/directory between the husky and laptop use the scp command.  

NOTE: The IP address below are for wired connection.  If using wireless you'll need to use the wireless husky IP.

An example of copying over the entire 'htp_auto' directory from the laptop to the husky is:
(executed from the laptop terminal at ~/ros/src/)
scp -pr htp_auto/. administrator@192.168.1.11:/home/administrator/ros/src/htp_auto

The p says to preserve file meta data
The r says to recursively copy all files and directories

Another useful examples is moving back the bag file named 'lab_test_1.bag' from the husky to the laptop.
(executed from the laptop terminal)
scp -p administrator@192.168.1.11:/home/administrator/bags/lab_test_1.bag ~/bags/lab_test_1.bag
