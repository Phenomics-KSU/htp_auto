First to find what services are available (after starting nodes):
rosservice list

Then to call a service:
rosservice call service_name -- args

To find out what arguments a service takes:
rosservice type service_name
then
rossrv show type_name (where type name was returned from 1st command)

For example to change current mission index to 2:
rosservice call /set_mission_index -- 2

Or to add command to mission:
rosservice call /add_mission_item -- '[0, 0, 400, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]'
