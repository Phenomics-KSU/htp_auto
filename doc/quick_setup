To open a bunch of tabs and commands:

1) Open terminal and navigate to ./htp_auto/tools/

2) If you haven't already give quick_start.bash execute permissions:
"chmod x+ ./quick_start.bash

3) Run the script using:
"./quick_start.bash"
  - NOTE: if using wired connection to husky append "wired" afterwards to set correct IP. 
       i.e. "./quick_start.bash wired"
  - NOTE: Do not type or click anywhere when script is running and tabs are still being opened.
          This includes maximizing the newly opened terminal.
